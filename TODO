WedgeUp To Do list:

First initial target
--------------------

Our first milestone should be functionality for

	- Parsing the supplied directory and subordinates
	- Checksumming each provided file (using a quick algorithm)
	- Comparing this against the previous incremental backup
		(the first backup increments from nothing, so this should be fine regardless)
	- Copy modified files to a subfolder in the backup destination, named by date
	- Checksum the files stored to ensure success
	- Update the WedgeUp database with these new checksums
	- Store a copy of the WedgeUp database to the destination

Secondary functionality should include

	- A backup test suite, primarily re-checksumming a mounted dataset
